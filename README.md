# Fork

This repository is forked from the CsBaseLanguage (https://github.com/vaclav/mpscs).
We develop/maintain the fork for the tailed use in ALFI transformation chains (https://github.com/vimotest/mps-alfi, https://github.com/vimotest/mps-alfi-to-cs)

# CsBaseLanguage

*CsBaseLanguage* is a project of the C# language implementation as a
[JetBrains MPS](https://www.jetbrains.com/mps/)
base language (for further information about *base languages*, see the
[MPS User's Guide](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/mps/mps-user-s-guide.html)).

The C# base language is distributed as a JetBrains MPS plugin. You can obtain it via
the JetBrains MPS Marketplace from your installed MPS.

## Supported C# Features

The C# base language is based on a subset of the C# 5.0 specification. Detailed specification
can be found [here](./doc/cs_specification.md).

Further references of C# are understood to reference this specified version.

## Repository vs. Plugin

This repository contains the most up-to-date version of the C# base language. It is intended for
the C# base language developers, not for its users. The TextGen aspect is auto-generated from the
Editor aspect. To prevent inconsistency, the TextGen is not included in this repository and must
be manually generated.

The plugin distributed via JetBrains MPS Marketplace contains a full binary version of the C#
base language, which is time-to-time generated from this repository.

Users who do not want to participate on the C# base language's development are
expected neither to use this repository nor to read the documentation contained in
it. **The language should be close enough to the standard C# so no documentation for
users of the plugin is necessary (and therefore is not provided). The documentation in
this plugin is intended for the plugin's developer community**.

## Target Platform

The C# base language is expected to work only in the context of the JetBrains MPS workbench.

It has been primarily tested on Windows 10, 64 bit and Windows 7, 64-bit. It should work on Unix-like platforms
as well, but maybe with minor problems, which should be, however, easily solvable by the
user.
